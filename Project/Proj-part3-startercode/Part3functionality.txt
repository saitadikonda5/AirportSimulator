I run my code by using the command: 
g++ ECConsoleUITextLabel.cpp ECTextViewImp.cpp ECConsoleUIView.cpp ECConsoleUIListBox.cpp ECConsoleUITextField.cpp ECConsoleUITest.cpp -o test

I tried implementing the textfield class but it doesn't work at all so I only focused on the listbox.

My listbox is completley functional, I'm able to scroll through the three different sections and navigate between them using ctrl A. My highlight
is slightly different but it is still completley functional. The highlighted row is indicated just by the cursor. The instructions say as long as
the code is fully functional and able to be interacted with in the same way then it is okay, so I assume this is fine.
